Upon successfully completing this workshop, I have demonstrated the following abilities:
1. Defined and implemented multiple constructors: I can create a `HealthCard` class with various constructors, including a default constructor and one 
that accepts all necessary parameters.
2. Defined and implemented the rule of three: I have a good understanding of the rule of three, which involves implementing the copy constructor, copy
assignment operator, and destructor to manage dynamic memory correctly.
3. Read formatted data using istream: I can use istream to read and parse formatted data, such as health card information, from input streams.
4. Write formatted data using ostream: I can use ostream to format and output data, including health card details, to output streams.
5. Overloaded the extraction and insertion operators for I/O: I have successfully overloaded the extraction (`>>`) and insertion (`<<`) operators for
the HealthCard class, allowing for user-friendly input and output operations using iostream.
