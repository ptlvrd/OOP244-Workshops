Workshop Reflection - OOP244 Workshop #2

During OOP244 Workshop #2, I learned several important concepts and had hands-on experience with C++ programming. Here are some of the key topics and my reflections on them:

1. File Input and Output:
   - I learned how to open, read, and close files using C++ standard libraries. This workshop emphasized reading CSV files and processing data from them.

2. Dynamic Memory Allocation:
   - Dynamic memory allocation was a significant part of this workshop. I learned how to allocate memory for arrays of structures (Population in this case) using the 'new' operator and deallocate it using 'delete[]'.

3. Sorting Algorithms:
   - The workshop required sorting populations in ascending order based on population size. I implemented a simple bubble sort algorithm to achieve this.
   
4. Modular Programming:
   - This workshop encouraged modular programming by dividing the code into separate functions for readability and maintainability.

Challenges and Issues:
- Understanding file I/O and parsing data from a CSV file was challenging initially. However, the workshop provided valuable insights into handling such tasks efficiently.

- Ensuring proper memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks was a crucial aspect of this workshop. I had to be careful with memory management.

- Sorting populations in ascending order required careful implementation of the sorting algorithm. I needed to ensure the correct comparison and swapping of elements.

Overall, completing this workshop helped me strengthen my C++ programming skills, especially in dealing with files, memory allocation, and string manipulation. It also emphasized the importance of modular programming for code organization and readability.
