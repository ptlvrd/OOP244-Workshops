I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.*/

Through this workshop, I've learned to define pure virtual functions, creating abstract base classes that act as templates for derived classes. I now understand how to implement
specific behaviors in these derived classes using virtual functions. The key takeaway is recognizing the difference between abstract base classes, serving as blueprints, and 
concrete classes, providing detailed implementations. The project milestones allowed me to design and implement classes like `Shape`, `LblShape`, `Line`, and `Rectangle`, 
employing concepts like inheritance and polymorphism for dynamic behavior. Despite facing challenges in overriding pure virtual functions and managing memory effectively, the 
handson experience has significantly improved my C++ and object-oriented programming skills.
