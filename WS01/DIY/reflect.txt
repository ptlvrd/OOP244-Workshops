the topics that i have learned in completing this workshop is tat i learned how to work with files in C++
using the FILE* to read data from a file. This included opening, reading, and closing files.
Additionally, I gained knowledge about error handling when opening files. secondly, I improved my skills 
in string manipulation using C++ strings. This included techniques like converting strings to lowercase,
searching for substrings, and using string functions such as find. This workshop reinforced the importance
of functions for code organization.The importance of breaking down code into modular functions became 
clear during this workshop. It enhances code reusability, readability, and maintainability.
I also faced cahllenges during this workshop, initially, I found file input using ifstream a bit
challenging, especially when dealing with different data formats in the file. However, I overcame this by
carefully reading documentation and practicing.There were moments when I struggled with string manipulation,
particularly when converting strings to lowercase. Debugging and reviewing documentation helped me solve
these issues. Deciding on the best design for the program and structuring the loops effectively took some
time. I had to refactor the code a few times to make it more efficient and readable.
