During this workshop, I learned about creating classes in C++, specifically, inheriting a derived class from a base class. This involves building on existing functionalities and adding
new ones in the derived class. I grasped the concept of shadowing, where the derived class can have its own version of a function that "shadows" the one in the base class. I also
understood how to access these shadowed functions and use them effectively. Additionally, I worked on custom input/output operators, enabling more flexible interactions with my classes.
While working on the workshop, I faced challenges in managing memory efficiently, especially dealing with potential memory leaks. Debugging and understanding the intricacies of dynamic 
memory allocation were key aspects that required careful attention. By studying the solutions, revisiting course notes, and spending dedicated time on each deliverable, I gained a clearer
understanding of these concepts. This hands-on experience has improved my skills in C++ programming, and I now appreciate the importance of proper memory management in creating robust and
effective code.
