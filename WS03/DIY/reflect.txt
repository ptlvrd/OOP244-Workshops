In this workshop, I learned about the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in C++. Classes act as blueprints for creating objects, and objects are
instances of these classes. I gained a deeper understanding of how to define and use classes to model real-world entities and their behaviors.I explored 
the importance of member initialization in class constructors. By initializing member variables properly, I ensured that objects started in a valid state.
Additionally, I learned about access control, specifically the public and private access specifiers. They helped me control the visibility of class members 
and data encapsulation.
One of the key challenges in this workshop was managing dynamic memory allocation. I had to use the 'new' operator to allocate memory dynamically and ensure
proper cleanup using delete. This was crucial in preventing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage in my programs.
