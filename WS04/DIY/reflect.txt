In completing this workshop, I learned about creating classes and working with dynamic memory allocation in C++. I also learned how to design and implement
constructors, destructors, and methods for a class. One challenge I faced was ensuring proper formatting of labels and input prompts when using `cin` and 
`cout` in the console. Additionally, I had to make sure to manage memory properly to avoid memory leaks, which occurred when I forgot to deallocate memory 
after dynamically allocating it. This experience taught me the importance of memory management in C++ programming. Overall, the workshop helped me gain a 
better understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and practical application in C++.
